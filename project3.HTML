                  An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold,sometimes risky.
                  Adventures may be activites with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
                  scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create 
                  psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that 
                  can only be obtained by such activities.

                  Adventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g.fear)
                  or positive (e.g.flow).For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According
                  to adventurer Andre Malraux, in his Man's Fate (1933),"If a man is not ready to risk his life,where is
                  his dignity?"

                    The bicycle has been used as a method of reconnaissance as well as transporting soldiers and supplies 
                    to combat zones.In this it has taken oven many of the functions of horses in warfare. In the Second 
                    Boer War, both sides used bicycles for scouting. In World War I,France,Germany,Australia and New Zealand
                    used bicycles to move troops.In its 1937 invasion of China,Japan employed some 50,000 bicycle troops, 
                    and similar forces were instrumental in Japan's march or "roll" through Malaya in World War II. Germany
                    used bicycles again in World War II, while the British employed airborne "Cycle-commandos" with folding 
                    bikes.

                    Cycling became popularlised in Europe and North America in the latter part and especially the last

                    Paragliding is the recreational and competive adventure sport of flying paragliders:lightweight,free-flying,
                    foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like
                    'pod'suspended below a fabric wing.Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air 
                    entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

                    Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres,though 
                    flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm.

                    Surfing is the surface water sport in which an individual,a surfer(or two in tandem surfing),uses a board 
                    to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards 
                    the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores,but can also be found in standing
                    waves in the open ocean, in lakes,in rivers,in the form of tidal bore,or in wave pools. Despite not using an
                    engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometers,though flights of one to
                    five hours and covering some tens of kilometers are more the norm.

                    The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance.There are several
                    types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft,while the native peoples of the Pacific 
                    surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
